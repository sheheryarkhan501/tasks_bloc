In order to get familiar with your skillset in flutter development, we are doing a code challenge test of people we are interested in.



If you are willing to take this code challenge, it will help us greatly in our decision making since this is an important hire for us, and will probably lead to a long term engagement.



If you decide to do the code challenge, here it is:



Background
Develop a simple and mock mobile app that lets you create/edit/sort/delete tasks.
This test is designed to assess your understanding of flutter along with how you handle making api calls, handling errors, and simple animations.



Project Description
User registration and authentication page
An authenticated user can create, view, update, and delete tasks.
Tasks can be sorted and their order can be changed.
Each task/subtask has a status (todo, in progress, done).



Requirements
Implement user registration and authentication using mock handlers/async events to imitate RESTful API calls. Firebase can also be used if preferred.
A static json file with a username/password will work
Design the task model to accommodate the hierarchical relationship between tasks and subtasks.
Simulate API calls with random timeouts between 500-1500ms to emulate real-world conditions.
For example, when you create a task, call a function as if you would in the real world, it waits a random number of ms, and then it handles the response as if it were in the real world
Please create some randomness and show how you would handle errors, for example. The server randomly responding with missing required fields, 503 for server being unavailable, and 500 for some server error



Screens/pages for user registration and login.
A dashboard to view all current tasks, create new tasks, and delete tasks.
Functionality to change the sort order of tasks by dragging and dropping.
Confirmation prompt for task deletion.
Animations for task creation, deletion, and reordering events, even if they are small.



Data Storage
Write and store tasks locally.



Submission
Submit your complete code, along with a README file explaining how to set up and run the application.



The goal of this project is to show strong competency in flutter to handle a production level app with more advanced features, proper error handling, proper api handling, push notifications, so please treat this as you would a production level app
